## 📖 **Introduction**
Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT by OpenAI have taken the world by storm.  Bill Gates said the ChatGPT demonstration he saw was, “the most stunning demo I’ve ever seen”.   Some education institutions such as New York City public schools  and UIC  banned, at least temporarily, the use of ChatGPT in the classroom, fearing students could do homework assignments using LLMs without learning the class material.

An app is needed to help teachers to create homework assignments that could not be easily done using LLMs without the students learning the class material.  This app is sorely needed because few teachers are aware of what LLMs could and could not do.  Furthermore, if used properly, LLMs can actually help students to learn the course material. 

We in the CST program are in better position than other programs in UIC to understanding the ability and limitation of LLMs.  So let’s build a website to help teachers and students to use LLMs properly and avoid their misuse.

As an open-source project, it also serves as a valuable reference for future students enrolled in SE or SDW courses.
